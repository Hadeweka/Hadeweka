### About me

I am working as a scientist in the field of theoretical and numerical physics, with focus on particle simulations.

Independent of work, my fields of interest are:
* Game design and development
* Game engine development
* Physics simulations

My main programming languages are:
* Ruby
* Crystal
* C++
* Julia
* C

I am currently working actively on the following projects:
* [Anyolite](https://github.com/Anyolite/anyolite) - mruby scripting in Crystal
* [Shidacea](https://github.com/Shidacea)/[Shipectral](https://github.com/Shidacea/Shipectral) - A 2D game engine with mruby scripting
* [Inuhh Shinvasion 2](https://github.com/Hadeweka/Inuhh-Shinvasion-2) - Planned action adventure built with Shipectral

Projects on hold:
Currently none
