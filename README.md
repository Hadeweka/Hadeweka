### About me

I am working as a scientist in the field of theoretical and numerical physics, with focus on particle simulations and plasma physics.

Independent of work, my fields of interest are:
* Game design and development
* Game engine development
* Physics simulations

My main programming languages are:
* Crystal
* Ruby
* C++/C
* Python

I am currently working actively on the following projects:
* [Anyolite](https://github.com/Anyolite/anyolite) - mruby scripting in Crystal
* [SDL-Crystal-Bindings](https://github.com/Hadeweka/SDL-Crystal-Bindings) - Raw SDL bindings for Crystal
* [Crystal2Day](https://github.com/Hadeweka/Crystal2Day) - A simple but powerful 2D game framework in Crystal
* [Inuhh Shinvasion](https://github.com/Hadeweka/Inuhh-Shinvasion) - A full jump'n'run game about a dog fighting aliens

Projects on hold:
* [Inuhh Shinvasion 2](https://github.com/Hadeweka/Inuhh-Shinvasion-2) - Planned action adventure built with Shipectral (currently in the design phase)

Projects, which are in a usable state but won't receive updates:
* [HDWQuantum](https://github.com/Hadeweka/HDWQuantum) - Very basic quantum computing simulation with less than 200 lines of code
* [CrysQuant](https://github.com/Hadeweka/CrysQuant) - Quantum computing library in Crystal, upgrade of HDWQuantum

Abandoned projects, which might still be interesting:
* [Shidacea](https://github.com/Shidacea)/[Shipectral](https://github.com/Shidacea/Shipectral) - A 2D game engine with mruby scripting
* [Shidacea-CPP](https://github.com/Shidacea/Shidacea-CPP) - Abandoned C++ implementation of the Shidacea game engine

Feel free to ask me anything about my projects or related topics.
