### About me

I am working as a scientist in the field of theoretical and numerical physics, with focus on particle simulations.

Independent of work, my fields of interest are:
* Game design and development
* Game engine development
* Physics simulations

My main programming languages are:
* Ruby
* Crystal
* C++
* Julia
* C

I am currently working actively on the following projects:
* [Anyolite](https://github.com/Anyolite/anyolite) - mruby scripting in Crystal
* [Shidacea](https://github.com/Shidacea/Shidacea)/[Shipectral](https://github.com/Shidacea/Shipectral) - A 2D game engine with mruby scripting
* Secret Anyolite demo project

Projects on hold:
* [Inuhh Shinvasion 2](https://github.com/Hadeweka/Inuhh-Shinvasion-2) - Planned action RPG, will be ported to Shipectral

Past projects which might be interesting:
* [Inuhh Shinvasion](https://github.com/Hadeweka/Inuhh-Shinvasion) - A full jump'n'run game about a dog fighting aliens
* [HDWQuantum](https://github.com/Hadeweka/HDWQuantum) - Very basic quantum computing simulation with less than 200 lines of code
* [CrysQuant](https://github.com/Hadeweka/CrysQuant) - Quantum computing library in Crystal, upgrade of HDWQuantum
